# World War Risk Analysis - Example Data

This directory contains example data files for demonstrating the World War III risk assessment capabilities.

## Files Description:

### sample_scenarios.json
Contains predefined geopolitical scenarios for testing the framework:
- Taiwan Strait Crisis
- Multi-Front Global Crisis  
- Nuclear Escalation Scenarios
- Alliance Cascade Events

### historical_conflicts.csv
Sample historical conflict data for training the event prediction models:
- Conflict dates and locations
- Fatality counts and event types
- Country involvement and outcomes

### alliance_networks.csv
Current military alliance and partnership data:
- NATO members and obligations
- Bilateral defense treaties
- Regional security partnerships

### trade_dependencies.csv

## Usage:

These files are used by the example notebooks and demonstration scripts to show how the framework analyzes different escalation scenarios and calculates World War III risk probabilities.

**Note:** All data is for demonstration purposes. In production, the framework would connect to live data sources like ACLED, GDELT, and World Bank APIs.
